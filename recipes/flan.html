      <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A dessert flan is made of eggs; sweetened condensed milk, cream or whole milk; and flavorings such as vanilla, orange, coconut, or coffee. Because egg-based custard is delicate, flan is baked in a water bath in the oven.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
          <li>3 eggs</li>
          <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
          <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
      
      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
          <li>In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, melt sugar until liquefied and golden in color. Carefully pour hot syrup into a 9 inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom and sides. Set aside.</li>
          <li>In a large bowl, beat eggs. Beat in condensed milk, evaporated milk and vanilla until smooth. Pour egg mixture into baking dish. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
          <li>Bake in preheated oven 60 minutes. Let cool completely.</li>
          <li>To serve, carefully invert on serving plate with edges when completely cool.</li>
        </ol>
